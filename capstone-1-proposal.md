# Capstone Project 1 Proposal

**Goal**: Build a database-driven website from an API of your choice

## Assignment Details

For your first Capstone Project, you’ll build a database-driven website off an external API of your choice. Your finished capstone will be an integral part of your portfolio; it will demonstrate to potential employers everything you’ve learned from this course. 

We want you to work on a challenging project that will incorporate all of the back-end skills you’ve been developing and some of your front-end skills from the last section. The goal of this project isn’t to create something that’s never been done before. You can create a website similar to one that already exists, or use a popular API. That being said, we do encourage you to be creative when building this site. You’re free to choose any API you’d like to use and we encourage you to tap into your imagination as you build your website. 

It is better to pick a project that errs on the side of simple and boring than a complex project with a million moving parts to get stuck in.  

1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
a. What does your database schema look like?
b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
d. What functionality will your app include?
e. What will the user flow look like?
f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
goals?
